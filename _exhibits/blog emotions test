The Germantown Y once offered a space for women to connect, play, learn, gather, and watching this community, these women, continuously work to save it shows how rare and treasured it was – is. Since the early 2000s, this building has slowly fallen into disrepair, even since a developer took control in 2016. This story is one of a community fighting to preserve cultural memory and connection, to see their community prosper. It is one of women, primarily aging, refusing to be silenced, demanding that to be heard. Yvonne Haskins, at a PRA meeting in 2021, spoke to the board members, eloquently encapsulating the preservation issues: “I am looking into your eyes and hoping that I am reaching your heart” (question: do I cite this to the date she told us she said it, or the date that she said it to us?). 
If this fight to save the Germantown Y conveys anything, it is that preservation is not possible without emotion. While the motivations and connection to this building might be unique for everyone, it is the emotional stake in the space, the neighborhood that provides the strength to keep pushing, after so long. For some, it’s the memories of this space, of what it meant to them, to their children, to their mothers. Others see the impact that revitalizing a (blighted) prominent building could have on uplifting this community. Even others are focused on the accessibility that this building and its parking lot offers. Nostalgia, fear, pride, love: all play a role, and all will determine the future of the Germantown Y.
