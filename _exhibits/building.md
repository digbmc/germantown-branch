The Colored Branch was housed in a relatively large, three story stone building on Germantown Avenue.  The property was approximately 40 x 125 feet large, containing the building, a lot behind it, a terrace, and tennis courts (TA, 24.3. Building - House Committee 1918 – 60). The building itself contained a variety of rooms, which included a living room, blue room, kitchen, third floor front and kitchen, club room, and a gymnasium (TA, 24.2. Building Correspondence 1926-55, 1945-1946). These spaces were used to host private parties, church groups, meetings, teas and receptions. Many of these spaces, including the tennis courts, were rented out for outside groups to use. Image 24.3.b. includes a list of the “house equipment” they had, which included dishes, glasses, linens, roller skates, and music equipment. 

In a video for the project, Germantown Speaks, old members reflect on their positive experiences with the building: 

> “it was a wonderful building, we never had to feel like we were deprived or separated because our building was lovely, we had no complaints because it was a handsome building” (02:42-02:52) 

> “we also had the best tennis court there in Philadelphia. It was made of cork and everyone came there for their summer parties” (00:45-00:57) 

Requests and work for improvement was constantly being done throughout the years. Since the Colored Branch was not an independent organization, it had to gain approval as well as funds from the main YWCA. It is unclear what exactly the nature of this relationship was, however, the power was clearly in favor of the white YWCA. A report from the 10th of January, 1945 complains about the poor state of the building:  

>“With the exception of two rooms, the office and the gym, this three story building of twelve rooms and four halls has not been redecorated or refurnished in more than ten years ... The building as a whole is much worse because of constant use in an effort to meet new trends and needs for community service ... shabby and inadequately furnished in the beginning ... impossible to carry on a satisfactory summer program in the building during the hottest months.” (TA, 24.2. Building Correspondence 1926-55).  

The report also included a request for additional funds of a total of $2,229.00 to redecorate and refurnish multiple rooms in the building. Some sections were left blank, however, so it is unclear if the request was ever sent.   

It appears that the building was not kept in good condition, especially towards the end, and therefore lost a lot of its value. The main YWCA claimed that it did not have the funds to continue the maintenance of the building and therefore had to sell it, despite protest and pushback from the Colored Branch. Because of the building’s important role as the home of the Colored Branch and a focal point for the Germantown Black community, many members fought to keep it. So while white leaders saw the closing of the 6128 building as a “triumph” for integration, black members did not share this sentiment. For them, this event was tragic and became “deeply ingrained in the mind of Germantown's black community” (Felix, 1999, 217), in fact, some black women refused to set foot in the YWCA afterwards. 

An appraisal of the building from 1952 [archive image of appraisal document: 24.3.d] lists the building as being worth $26, 500, and the land as $30,000 for a total sum of $56,500. The appraisal recommends that, since the building is not as valuable as the land, it be torn down and converted into parking. This did not happen and instead was sold to another organization and still exists today as the home of the Settlement Music School.
