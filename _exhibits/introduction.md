## History of the Black Community of Germantown

Black people have lived in Germantown from as early as 1790, when records indicate that Germantown had 26 “non-white” [^fn1] inhabitants, who were mostly enslaved. In 1850 this number increased to encompass 1-2% of the Germantown population, however the population really began growing in the 1870’s and 1880’s. During this time, the black community began building their own community enclaves since Germantown was a segregated community, with the black and white population having separate schools, churches, and “social welfare efforts”[^fn1]: 
- 1850-1890: 5 black churches 
- 1868-1886: 3 black public schools 
- 1838-1894: 4 social welfare institutions

The Germantown black community was excluded from most white institutions, and “in general, Black social welfare in Germantown would be kept in the Black community”[^fn1]. Examples of organizations. founded by and for Black people in Germantown include the Tabernacle Home Mission and Industrial School. Despite class diversity and conflict within the black community, racial solidarity took first priority and ultimately kept the community together[^fn1].
