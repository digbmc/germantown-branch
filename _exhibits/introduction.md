The Colored Branch was an all-black branch of the Germantown YWCA whose function was to: 
>“eventually make possible for every colored girl and woman the advantages so long enjoyed by the white girls and women of our community and to serve the present day need from the point of view of both the individual and the community” (115).

The YWCA’s racist policies prevented black members from joining the main YWCA, forcing them to create their own branch. Furthermore, the racism and segregation black residents faced at this time created the need for an all-black space with community services, resources and support by and for the black community. The Colored Branch was important because it “was a center of the Black Germantown community” (Felix, 123) and a “focal point for Black heritage in Germantown and Philadelphia” (127) whose legacy still lasts today. Constance Ragsdale, a former member of the YWCA, reflects on the impact that the Colored Branch had: 

>“The Y was sort of guiding all of these women to [...] come in and contribute to society. [...] and that was the good thing about the African American Y, you know, don't let the color of your skin hold you back from doing what you want to do and not showcasing yourself. And I think this is what this was about.” (Constance Ragsdale, Oral History, October 25th, 2024) 

The Colored Branch, also known as the Germantown Colored Branch, Branch Y, or the Colored Y, was first founded in 1917 and in 1918 moved into a building at 6128 Germantown Avenue. The Colored Branch’s activities were similar to those of the main, all-white Germantown YWCA. They hosted club events, socials, dances, Christian religious services, service and volunteer work, educational classes, physical sports (they had a tennis court), as well as a variety of “race-pride” (Felix, 1999, 124) activities and events, such as supporting the NAACP and co-organizing Negro Achievement Week.

The Branch had a strong relationship to Christianity as well as to local black churches. In fact, many of the Colored Branch’s leadership, like Olivia (Yancy) Taylor, who was the “first elected and first Black Branch Chairman” (125), also had prominent church positions and sometimes meetings would start and end in prayer. 

The Colored Branch had its own leadership that was integrated and became increasingly black, however was still ultimately under the control of the main YWCA because of white YWCA members’ racist assumptions that they were incapable of leadership. In fact, until 1924, no black woman was allowed to be chair of the Colored Branch. 

The Colored Branch had a long, successful and busy career spanning from 1917 until the early 1950’s. The branch was a strong source of community and is reflected positively on by old YWCA members in [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVVQdut2pCA) from the project Germantown Speaks:  

>“we never had to feel like we were deprived or separated because our building was lovely [...] that Y was where we were allowed to go” 

>“[Clarice Herbert] said you girls were something because we did everything” 

During this time, black people were still prohibited from joining the main YWCA and using their pool, which was a major point of conflict. However, starting in the 1940’s discussion about integration as well as interracial activities became increasingly common until in April 1946 the National YWCA passed an Interracial Charter to end racial segregation. This was a radical decision at the time, that was welcomed by the Colored Branch and the main Y, although problems with racism persisted. While integration was a necessary step in the right direction, it also came with the reduction of Colored Branch activities and ultimately the sale of their building in 1952, marking the final end of the Colored Branch. This was a hard loss for the Germantown black community, who fought to keep their organization and their building. The Germantown YWCA and it’s Colored Branch were not alone in this struggle, many YWCA Colored Branches and other all-black institutions were being integrated and closed during this time all around the country. 

Ultimately, the Germantown YWCA Colored Branch was an invaluable institution for the local black community and important member of the Germantown YWCA organization.
